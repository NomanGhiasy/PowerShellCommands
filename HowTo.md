## How to save your PowerShell output to a raw text file:
Out-File is the cmdlet you‚Äôre looking for.
To use the Out-File cmdlet, you can either use the piping operator to pass output to it or the **-InputObject** parameter to specify the objects to be written to the file.
**Get-Process | Out-File C:\Temp\processes.txt**
Or:
**$proc = Get-Process**
**Out-File C:\Temp\processes.txt -InputObject $proc**
These commands provide the same results, creating a text file containing the output of the Get-Process cmdlet. It‚Äôs important to note that the information in the text file will be formatted as if sent to the terminal window.





## How To Run A PowerShell Script
There are two main ways to make a PowerShell script:
The first, which will be familiar if you‚Äôve used Windows Command Line before, is to write scripts directly in notepad. For example, open a new notepad file, and write:

**Write-Host ‚ÄúHello World!‚Äù**

Then save this file as FirstScript.ps1

You can call the script from PowerShell using the command:

& "**X:\FirstScript.ps1**"

And you‚Äôll see the output in PowerShell.

The second, much more powerful way of making PowerShell scripts is to use the Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE). With ISE, you can run scripts and debug them in a GUI environment.
